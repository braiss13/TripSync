# TripSync

TripSync is a shared ride management website (BlaBlaCar style) project that uses the python language, in addition to technologies such as flask, tailwind or Redis.

Structure is based in users (CRUD) who make trips (with a time, origin, destination, duration and fare), to which other users can sign up. Users can rate a trip they have taken, after the fact, and thus give the user a score.
